    "readme": " React Fiber Architecture IntroductionReact Fiber is an ongoing reimplementation of React's core algorithmIt is the culmination of over two years of research by the React team.The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gesturesIts headline feature is **incremental rendering**: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitivesAbout this documentFiber introduces several novel concepts that are difficult to grok solely by looking at codeThis document began as a collection of notes I took as I followed along with Fiber's implementation in the React projectAs it grew, I realized it may be a helpful resource for others, too.I'll attempt to use the plainest language possible, and to avoid jargon by explicitly defining key termsI'll also link heavily to external resources when possible.Please note that I am not on the React team, and do not speak from any authority**This is not an official document**I have asked members of the React team to review it for accuracy.This is also a work in progress**Fiber is an ongoing project that will likely undergo significant refactors before it's completed.** Also ongoing are my attempts at documenting its design hereImprovements and suggestions are highly welcome.My goal is that after reading this document, you will understand Fiber well enough to , and eventually even be able to contribute back to ReactPrerequisitesI strongly suggest that you are familiar with the following resources before continuing:   \"Component\" is often an overloaded termA firm grasp of these terms is crucial  A highlevel description of React's reconciliation algorithm  A description of the conceptual model of React without implementation burdenSome of this may not make sense on first readingThat'",

AbstractFor a system administrator, having to perform security vulnerability analysis and software update on a daily basis can be a burden.To avoid downtime in a production environment, it is common for a system administrator to choose not to use the automatic update option provided by the package manager and to perform update manually.This leads to the following problemsThe system administrator will have to constantly watch out for any new vulnerabilities in NVD (National Vulnerability Database) or similar databasesIt might be impossible for the system administrator to monitor all the software if there are a large number of software packages installed in the serverIt is expensive to perform analysis to determine the servers affected by new vulnerabilitiesThe possibility of overlooking a server or two during analysis is there.Vuls is a tool created to solve the problems listed aboveIt has the following characteristicsInforms users of the vulnerabilities that are related to the systemInforms users of the servers that are affectedVulnerability detection is done automatically to prevent any oversightA report is generated on a regular basis using CRON or other methodsto manage vulnerability.!

    "readme": " Chokidar > Minimal and efficient crossplatform file watching library Why?Node.js `fs.watch`:* Doesn't report filenames on MacOS.* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS.* Often reports events twice.* Emits most changes as `rename`.* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.* Does not support recursive watching on Linux.Node.js `fs.watchFile`:* Almost as bad at event handling.* Also does not provide any recursive watching.* Results in high CPU utilization.Chokidar resolves these problems.Initially made for **, it is now used in,,,,,,,and .It has proven itself in production environments.Version 3 is out! Check out our blog post about it:  How?Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events itreceives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin`FSEvents` APIThis provides very efficient recursive watching compared withimplementations like `kqueue` available on most \\*nix platformsChokidar stilldoes have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.On most other platforms, the `fs.watch`based implementation is the default, whichavoids polling and keeps CPU usage downBe advised that chokidar will initiatewatchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have beenspecified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching muchmore than neededGetting startedInstall with npm:```shnpm install chokidar```Then `require` and use it in your code:```javascriptconst chokidar = require('chokidar');// Oneliner for current directorychokidar.watch('.').on('all', (event, path) => {  console.log(event, path);});``` API```javascript// Example of a more typical implementation structure// Initialize watcher.const watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {  ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../, // ign",
